# ðŸŽ¨ React Native FontAwesome 6

```ts
import { Worm } from '@404-software/fontawesome/solid'

export const Icon = () => <Worm />
```

## Overview

- ðŸ˜Ž Free, beautiful icons
- ðŸ”¥ Customizable with `react-native-svg` props
- ðŸŒ² Tree-shaken components
- ðŸ¤– TypeScript support
- ðŸ“ˆ JS-only (+ works with Expo)

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @404-software/fontawesome react-native-svg
```

## Usage

Each icon is exported as its own component with an adjusted name.

For example, to use the `angle-down` icon, import `AngleDown`:

```tsx
import { AngleDown } from '@404-software/fontawesome/solid'
```

You can also `import * as FontAwesome`:

```tsx
import * as FontAwesome from '@404-software/fontawesome/solid'

export const Icon = () => <FontAwesome.AngleDown />
```

For a full directory of components, see the [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons) website.

### Custom color

```tsx
<ArrowUp color="black" />
```

### Custom size

```tsx
<ArrowUp height={30} width={30} />
```

## Props

Each icon component accepts all the props from `react-native-svg`'s `Svg` component. Reference [their docs](https://github.com/react-native-svg/react-native-svg#svg).

## How it works

This library uses `react-native-svg`. The components are generated by `svgr`. I downloaded all the free icons from [fontawesome.com](https://fontawesome.com) and [ran a script](/generate/index.ts) to codegen the files from there.
